  "description": "Temperature & Humidity Sensor uses the AHT20 sensor, to measures temperature and humidity in the atmosphere at the range of -40℃ to 85℃ and 0 to 100 %RH with accuracy ±0.2℃ and ±0.2%RH respectively, also with highly waterproof performance tested to IP68, making it widely applicable in agricultural environmental sensing scenarios to support the smart agricultural production.\n\nThe sensor benefits from LoRaWAN , which ensures stability and reliability. It is capable of covering a long transmission range while maintaining low power consumption. Unlike wireline devices, it is battery-powered, reducing the workload and complexity of deployment, design and development for end-users that can work via powering it , and setting the configuration in the cloud server, for LoRaWAN® remote monitoring.  It monitors the air temperature and humidity and report them every 1 hour."
