  "description": "Positioning Water Leak Sensor detects water leakage at fixed points. Suitable for applications such as garage/kitchen water leakage detection. It reports the water leakage via LoRaWANÂ® protocol instantly as leakage detected. The sensor benefits from LoRaWAN, which ensures stability and reliability. It is capable of covering a long transmission range while maintaining low power consumption. Unlike wireline devices, it is battery-powered, reducing the workload and complexity of deployment, design and development for end-users that can work via powering it, and setting the configuration in the cloud server."
