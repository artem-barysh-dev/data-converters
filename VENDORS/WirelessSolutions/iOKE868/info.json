  "description": "iOKE868 Smart Metering Kit compliant with LoRaWAN速 leverages the long range and low power of LoRa速 to provide real-time data monitoring of energy consumption and secure connectivity to a LoRaWAN速 IoT network. It is compatible with most modern smart meters (compliant with IEC62056-21 and SML messages). The optical reading unit iO881A can be attached magnetically to the smart meter to read out the infrared interface, extract the desired values and transfer those to a LoRaWAN速 network with a period defined by the user."
